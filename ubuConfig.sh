# BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
#   * Ensure that your network is fully and properly configured, especially your DNS.
#   * Pre-testing sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade to see if there are any errors may be one way of doing this
#
#   * This script will pull everything you need to successfully compile PennMUSH v1.8.6rc1p1 with MySQL support enabled.
#   * This script will pull everything you need to have a lAMP (linux-based Apache MySQL Preprocessor server running
#     ** This script will install both PHP and Python as well as run the Apache Mod configurations needed to run both 
#        PHP and Python scripts as CGI Preprocessor pages.
#     ** Successfully configuring individual sites via sites-available, sites-enabled, .htaccess, and PHP or Python scripts 
#        is still up to you.

# If at any time your machine gives you errors (typically on any sudo callout) "unable to resolve host <insert your machine name here>" 
# then you must edit your /etc/hosts file and add your machine name after localhost
#
# ALWAYS MAKE DAMN SURE YOU KEEP LOCALHOST AS AN ALIAS FOR 127.0.0.1
#
# The tippy-top first line of your /etc/hosts file should look something like:
# ie:  127.0.0.1 localhost myMachineName someAdditionalAlias
#

#
# If ubu16 sticks on apt-get update while trying to connect to security.ubuntu.com, then your server has a problem connecting 
# over IPv6.  This is an issue with your host or ISP so all you can really do is fix up your linux box.
#
# To do that you must:
#     sudo nano /etc/gai.conf
#   * (or whatever your favorite/installed editor is, if not nano)
#
# Under the line:  
#     # For sites which prefer IPv4 connections change the last line to
#
# Uncomment what follows by removing its # (don't remove the # in THIS file - remove the # in gai.conf)
# Change from:
#     # precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100
# to:
#     precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100
#
# This script will NOT attempt to auto-correct this problem for you because it does not generate any error code and that means 
# the script would have to run the "fix" up front and in all events, and it simply isn't needed in most cases.

#   press N to NOT change the root password (the one you already set is fine)
#   press Y to DO remove anonymous users
#   press Y to DO disallow root login remotely (you can only login from localhost, ie from the mysql app/shell, from PHP/Python/MUSH apps 
#     [not that you should ever log in as root from any app but the mysql shell app]) but the point is that the root username can only be used 
#     to log into mysql on the local system (yes you can still log in as root through SSH terminal connections - that's localhost as far as mysql 
#     is concerned - also be aware that mysql's root user and your linux box's root user are 2 different things)
#   press Y to DO remove test database and access to it (unless you're brand spanking new to MySQL and you really want or need the study material)
#   press Y to DO reload privilege tables and therefore make your changes effective as of now
#   * I'm pretty sure there's no platform where keystroke alone invokes the option - it's always Y or N followed by ENTER
